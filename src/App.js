                        I'm Jacob Hayward, and this is a website I have made to showcase my previous work, and the
                        projects
                        I work on whilst looking for my next step. I enjoy learning about Computer Programming, Data Science
                        and how the world around me works. I am working towards a career in quantitative analysis so my
                        portfolio is mainly Machine Learning, python, and SQL projects. I am also planning on doing a
                        finance course in the near future, to learn how to evaluate a securities intrinsic value.
                        Please get in contact if you're interested in my work or have any advice on improvements, enjoy!

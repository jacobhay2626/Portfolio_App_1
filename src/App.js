                        I'm Jacob Hayward, and this is a website I have made to showcase my previous work, and the
                        projects
                        I work on whilst looking for my next step. I enjoy learning about Computer Programming, Data
                        Science
                        and how the world around me works.
                        Please get in contact if you're interested in my work or have any advice on improvements, enjoy!
